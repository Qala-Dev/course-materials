description: your first bitcoin / lightning project

# Your first project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic working knowledge of Bitcoin and Lightning. This project is meant to be simple, but don't worry: there will be plenty of time throughout the rest of the course for more complicated projects!

## Goals

* Demonstrate proficiency working on signet / testnet
* Get experience with writing your first design document
* Build a working payment workflow using either Bitcoin or Lightning
* Address UX challenges users might face

## Deliverables

* A design document
* Working infrastructure on signet / testnet
* A simple application which requires someone to make a payment, either with Bitcoin or Lightning (or both!)
  * This can be built as a front-end application, back end application, API or a command line tool but it must be something a user can interact with
* Confirmation to the user once payment has been received

This project is meant to be simple to allow you to get familiar with the process of writing a design doc and scoping features. Additionally, since you will all be working on the same prompt, you will be able to collaborate with your peers if you run into issues.

### Timeline

* Design document due by Friday, but the sooner the better
* Project demo due the following Friday
  * Projects can still be a work in progress, the goal is to show what you've done so far
