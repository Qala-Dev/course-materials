# Week 5

This week, we'll continue with the "Mastering Lightning" book, holding discussions in small groups as you answer discussion questions. We'll also be having workshops on node management.

Also, we'll be working on more projects or expanding, refining or improving a project you have already started. 

As usual, a web-reader-friendly hosted version of Mastering Lightning book can be found at [lnbook.256k1.dev](https://lnbook.256k1.dev), which can be accessed for educational purposes using username and password `qala:lightning`.

## Prerequisites

* All the previous weeks' developer environments for both Bitcoin and Lightning Network.
* All the previously assigned chapters of Mastering Lightning book.

## Goals

At the end of the week, we hope that you will:

* Gain practical knowledge of how to manage a Mining Node
* Understand Channel Operation and Payment Forwarding
  * Managing HTLCs
  * Committing HTLCs to Channel state
  * Channel Balance
* Understand Path Finding and Payment Delivery
* Understand Lightning Payment Requests

If you finish your chapter(s) for the day early, feel free to move on to the next day's chapter(s), as repetition is key when it comes to absorbing so much knowledge.

## Deliverables

Each day, do the required reading and:

* Be prepared for the daily discussion groups:
  * Finish reading the chapter(s) for the day
  * Prepare and research your assigned question(s), make sure you can host the discussion and think about follow-up questions etc
  * Prepare and research the questions hosted by other people in your group
* Select a project from the [project list](../projects.md) to work on or improve an already existing project by refining or adding more functionality.


## Project demos 

We are reserving 30 minutes every Thursday for demo time! We highly encourage participation so you can show off what you built!
This week we will be hearing all about the wallet project you've all been working on.

Read all about them on https://course.qala.dev/meetings and reserve your slot once you've got something to share.
Demos don't need to be perfect or beautiful, just let us all share in your excitement and experience!
