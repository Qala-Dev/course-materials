# Week 5

This week, we'll continue with the "Mastering Lightning" book, holding discussions in small groups as you answer discussion questions. We'll also be having workshops on node management.

Also, we'll be working on more projects or expanding, refining or improving a project you have already started. 

As usual, a web-reader-friendly hosted version of Mastering Lightning book can be found at [lnbook.256k1.dev](https://lnbook.256k1.dev), which can be accessed for educational purposes using username and password `qala:lightning`.
