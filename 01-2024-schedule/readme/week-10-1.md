# Week 11

## Primary focus

This week, we will re-focus on Open Source Projects.

Having contributed a few weeks ago, you are to identify an Open Source project or continue working on the earlier identified project(s), with more impactful issues. While contributing, constantly provide updates on the progress you are making on the issues you are working on.

**Design Document**

You are expected to deepen your contributions to the projects you already have identified or identify one to start making impactful contributions. You will identify issue(s) you intend to work on, design and submit a document for approval describing the issue and why you want to work on it and how you feel that your skills are suited to it. You must complete the design document and have it approved _before_ proceeding with any contributions.

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.

### Blog posts

You will continue to write and publish blog posts and give updates accordingly.
