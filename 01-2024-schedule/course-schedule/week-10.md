### Meetings with Open Source Maintainers

Each session will last a maximum of one hour. Access links to the sessions can be found on calendar. Ensure you make time to attend and have your questions ready.&#x20;

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.
