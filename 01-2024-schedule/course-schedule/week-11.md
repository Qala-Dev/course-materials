# Week 11

## Primary focus

This week, our primary focus will be to continue working on Open Source Projects and Present our research.&#x20;

We expect that you have already identified a project to work on and have prepared/submitted a Design Document stating the specific issue(s) you will be working on. If, however, you have not been able to do that, you are expected to complete the process at the beginning of this week and be fully focused on completing the issues.

Alongside the Open Source Projects, you are expected (as a group) to identify a Topic, research and make a presentation. You can select any topic of your choice in the Bitcoin/Lightning Network, ensure to research deeply and select a time slot to present your findings. Be prepared to answer questions from the group on your research.

Remember to ask for help if you need it. This is a great opportunity to learn from others and improve your skills.

We wish you all the best in your Open Source Project, Research & Presentations this week!
