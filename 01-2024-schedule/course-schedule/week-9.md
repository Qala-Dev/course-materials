# Week 9

## Primary focus

This week, the primary focus will be on completing your group projects.

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.

### Blog posts

You will continue to write and publish blog posts and give updates accordingly.

### Bitcoin Philosophy Discussion

We will be completing the Bitcoin Philosophy Discussion during the week by reading sections 6-8 of [Bitcoin development philosophy](https://rosenbaum.se/btcphil/#\_what\_to\_expect) by Kalle Rosenbaum and Linn√©a Rosenbaum.

Similar to the previous week, you are expected to attend Group discussions on Tuesday (Section 6-8). You are also expected to be prepared for your discussion by reading the chapters for the day and researching your assigned question(s) as well as other questions and contribute meaningfully in the discussion.

### Office Hours

On Wednesday, we will have an hour-long Office Hour from 2-3pm.

### Show & Tell

On Friday, you will have the opportunity to demo your group projects to everyone. Show off what you've built, tell us how it works and what you learned. [Here ](../meetings.md)is how we expect the sessions to go.

Contact your home group responsible to book a slot once your project is ready.
