# Week 8

## Primary focus

This week, you will be assigned a group to work on a project.&#x20;

This gives you an opportunity to showcase your pre-existing skills, and combine them with your new bitcoin and lightning knowledge to build something really innovative as a team.

Once you've formulated your idea as a team, you are expected to create a detailed plan. The plan will contain a break down of tasks into smaller achievable goals which are specific and measurable. Ensure to indicate an MVP end goal where you would consider the project in a workable (alpha) state.&#x20;

We look forward to see what you will be building!&#x20;

### Bitcoin Philosophy Discussion

During the course of the week, you are also expected to read some of Bitcoin’s design trade-offs and development philosophy using [Bitcoin development philosophy](https://rosenbaum.se/btcphil/#_what_to_expect) by Kalle Rosenbaum and Linnéa Rosenbaum. 

You are expected to cover Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the course of the week and attend Group discussions on Wednesday (Section 1, 2) and Thursday (Section 3, 4 and 5). You are expected to be prepared for your discussion by reading the chapters for the day and researching your assigned question(s) as well as other questions and contribute meaningfully in the discussion.
