# Week 6

## Primary focus

This week, our primary focus will be to work on and complete all Open Source Projects. We expect that you have already identified a project to work on and have prepared/submitted a Design Document stating the specific issue(s) you will be working on. If, however, you have not been able to do that, you are expected to complete the process at the beginning of this week and be fully focused on completing the issues.

Remember to ask for help if you need it. This is a great opportunity to learn from others and improve your skills.

We wish you all the best in your Open Source Project endeavors this week!

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with the project(s) and blog posts.
