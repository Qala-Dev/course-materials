# Week 6

## Primary focus

This week, the primary focus will be on Open Source Projects.

### Monday

We will start the week by having a Contributing Etiquette Workshop that will prepare us on how to contribute to Open Source Projects.

**Design Document**

After the workshop, you are expected to identify a project to work on alongside specific issues, design and submit a document for approval describing the issue and why you want to work on it and how you feel that your skills are suited to it. You must complete the design document and have it approved _before_ proceeding with any contributions.

### Personal Updates

Daily updates on your personal progress with projects and blog posts.

### Blog posts

You will continue to write and publish blog posts and give updates accordingly.
